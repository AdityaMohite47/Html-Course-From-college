Lists in HTML :

Lists are the unique way to display a content in a parent-child relation

There are 3 types of lists :

1. Ordered list : This list shows content in order.

tags : <ol inputmode="1"> order list tag : input mode decides the no for the list items like [1. 2. ....] default value
    is text [A. B. ....]

    <li> list item tag : just like "<td>" tag , it is used to add elements to the list.

    </li>
</ol>


2. unordered list : This list has no particular order of elements.

tags : <ul> unordered list tag : default input type value is dots , elements of this list have no specific order.
    <li>

    </li>
</ul>



Selectors in CSS : Selectors enable us to apply css to specific attributes even if they are under some tag and that tag is applied some different
                    style.   

                    types of selectors :
                    1. tag selectors : default css type of selectors. 
                    2. id selectors : these selector add style by difference in their id.
                    3. class selectors : these selectors add style to the tags with same class .
                    4. universal selectors : '.' is notation for it and it applies style to all tags if they are not applied any specifically.
