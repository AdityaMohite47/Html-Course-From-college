# Array can be implemented using lists in python and vairous operations can be performed by already defined functions 

Arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# traversed through for loop 
# for i in Arr:
#     print(i)

# insertion using insert()
# Arr.insert(0 , 0)
# for i in Arr:
#     print(i)

# insertion at last 
# Arr.append(69)
# for i in Arr:
#     print(i)

# joining two lists extend()
# Arr2 = [3 , 6]
# Arr.extend(Arr2)
# for i in Arr:
#     print(i)

# deleting last element 
# Arr.pop()
# for i in Arr:
#     print(i)

# deleting first occurence of a specific value in array
Arr.remove(2)
